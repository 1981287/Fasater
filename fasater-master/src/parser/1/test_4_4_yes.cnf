c DESCRIPTION: Instance arises from the problem of learning the parity
c              function.  
c
c     parxx-y denotes a parity problem on xx bits.  y is simply the
c     intance number.
c
c     parxx-y-c denotes an instance identical to parxx-y except that
c     the instances have been simplified (to create an equivalent
c     problem). 
c
c NOTE: Satisfiable (checked for 8 and 16 size instances. All
c       instances are satisfiable by construction)
